# DS-Java-GroceryStore

In this project we built a Grocery store using Data Structures and Algorithms in Java.
The data structures I implemented in the projects are (Linked Lists, Vectors, Dictionaries, Queues, Stacks, Graphs).
We were not allowed to use any librabry and in built function for this problem, so I did the project from scratch after creating the methods and functions and use them later.
